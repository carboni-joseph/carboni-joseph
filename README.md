## About Me
Hello! I'm Joseph, a versatile programmer with a unique journey through the realms of bioinformatics, neuroscience, sales, and now back to the world of coding. My academic beginnings in a bioinformatics lab equipped me with self-taught R programming skills (since forgotten), with which I developed a ribosomal loading model on mRNA. Simultaneously, I contributed to neuroscience research, resulting in a published [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0091305714001038?via%3Dihub).

Transitioning from academia, I spent six years in sales, which broadened my perspective on business and client relations. This experience was invaluable, but my passion for programming prevailed.
